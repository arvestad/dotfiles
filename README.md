A way to save away my .bash_profile files etc. And other settings. 
# Dot files

This repo is supposed to store files that keep settings etc. 

First example is .bash_arve, which I source from .bash_profile. 

Note that I avoid putting .bash_profile in there since it may be touched
by various installers. 

The goal is to easily set up a new computer with my fav settings. Yes, this
is based on experience. Thanks for asking.
