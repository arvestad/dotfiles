A way to save away my .bash_profile files etc. And other settings. 

This repo is supposed to store files that keep settings etc. First example is .bash_arve, which I source from .bash_profile. Note that these files might not show up with `ls`, you need to do `ls -a`.

I avoid putting .bash_profile in there since it may be touched
by various installers. 

The goal is to easily set up a new computer with my fav settings. Yes, this
is based on experience. Thanks for asking.

## Current files

* .bash_arve, to be included by .bash_profile
* .gitconfig
* .gitignore
* .emacs
